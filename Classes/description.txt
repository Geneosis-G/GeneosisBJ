[quote=About this mod]I thought about some kind of infinite bag a long time ago but forgot it almost immediately. After discussing with NovaTempest4892 on the King Goat page about the possibility to make a Kirby Goat, I remembered this idea and decided to make the mod when I will have a moment ^^
The result is the Bottomless Jar, which work a bit like the IIC : it teleport the objects you store in a place far away outside the map, and then teleport them back in front of you when you want them back.
